Prototype Refactor

1. Copy and paste your code or the solution from yesterday

2. Your goal is to refactor all of this code to use ES6 Classes. The console.log() statements should still return what is expected of them.

  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.
*/

// EXAMPLE SOLUTION CODE:
function Airplane(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.isFlying = false;
  }
  Airplane.prototype.takeOff = function() {
    this.isFlying = true;
  };

    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
      - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
          + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
          + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

    TASK 4
  
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. Global Binding - When .this is used in a global function, it refers to the window object
    2. Implicit Binding/Automatic Binding - When .this is used inside an object method, it is bound to the immediate object.
    3. Explicit Binding - When .this is bound to an object stated explicitly using call, apply or bind
    4. New Binding - This uses the new keyword and .this here is bound to the newly constructed object
